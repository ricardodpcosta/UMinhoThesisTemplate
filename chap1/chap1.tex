% - Plain chapter template
% - In this chapter format, sections begin on the same page as the title
% - A table of contents and list of figures and tables can be generated for this chapter individually,
% and for that uncomment the commands \minitoc, \minilof, and \minilot below
% - If any of the above commands are used, also uncommented the command \newpage below for a
% page break (in that case, sections start on the next available page)
% - Sections in this chapter are also included in different files for the sake of organization (especially
% useful for large documents) but a single file with all the sections can also be used
% - All the sections, figures, tables, and any other material used in this chapter are in folder include/
% but any other structure can be used providing the appropriate paths to the commands
% - A bibliography can be generated for this chapter individually, and for that uncomment the last
% commands at the end of this file and provide the path to the bibliography file
% - The last three commands are suffixed with "chapi", which is an identifier for the bibliography
% included in the current chapter, in that case chap1
% - Replace the suffix "chapi" with "chapii", "chapiii", "chapiv", "chapv", etc. according to the current
% chapter number and for each chapter you want to generate an individual bibliography (for instance,
% in "chap6.tex" replace the suffix "chapi" with "chapvi" in the last three commands)
% - If individual bibliographies are used for each chapter, comment the last commands in the main
% file to not generate a global bibliography (it is recommended to have either a global bibliography
% or individual bibliographies for each chapter)
% - Consider using the prefix "chapX:" (replace X with the chapter number) in each label you create
% for the sections, figures, tables, equations, and bibliography to avoid duplicate references between
% chapters (for instance, \label{chap1:some_figure}, @article{chap1:some_paper}, etc.)
