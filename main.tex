% - This is a LaTeX template for academic works formatted according to the rules for doctoral theses,
% master's dissertations, internship reports, and project reports from the University of Minho officially
% published in "Despacho RT-31/2019"
% - It is recommended to read carefully the official documents in folder UMinhoThesisOfficial and
% check whether modifications to the formatting rules currently in this template have been introduced
% - Below you can find a tutorial with a sequence of steps to guide you in adapting this template to
% your work and further instructions are provided in the included files
% - Follow the steps and make sure the template compiles without errors after the necessary changes
% are made according to the instructions
% - Make sure you have LaTeX installed on your computer and run the command "pdflatex main" on
% the command line to generate the PDF document
% - In most LaTeX editors (Texmaker, MiKTeX, etc.), shortcuts from buttons exist for that purpose
% and usually need to be run from the main file (main.tex)
% - Compiling twice is required for cross-references of figures, tables, equations, etc. to be correctly
% generated and referenced in the generated PDF document
% â€“ Check the script "./makemain.sh" provided in this template folder for further information on the
% compilation steps needed
% - Recommended LaTeX editor is Texmaker (https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/) or Overleaf
% (https://overlead.com/)

% STEP 2 - PRELIMINARIES
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% 2.1 - The following pages are required to be included in the doctoral theses and master's works,
% except for the acknowledgements and the publications and awards sections
% 2.2 - Comment out the line of the acknowledgements and the publications and awards if you do not
% want them to be included in the generated PDF document
% 2.3 - Open each of the files below, edit the personal and work data as necessary, and follow the
% instructions provided to complete the required information
% 2.4 - The template automatically generates a table of contents and lists of figures, tables, and
% nomenclature for your work
% 2.5 - Choose below the indexes to be generated and comment the predefined selection as
% necessary (for instance, if your work has no tables or you do not want them to be indexed in a
% list of tables, comment both the commands \dominilot and \listoftables, otherwise an empty list
% will be generated)

% STEP 3 - CHAPTERS AND SECTIONS
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% 3.1 - There are two formats for the chapters (plain chapters and article chapters), which you can
% choose from the provided templates below
% 3.2 - Plain chapters have their sections beginning on the same page as the title, article chapters
% have an abstract and keywords on the first page while sections begin on the next page
% 3.3 - Article chapters are more appropriate when your work is based on articles or when you want
% to include a general introduction/motivation to the topic before actually starting to develop it
% 3.4 - Each chapter corresponds to a different folder named chap1, chap2, chap3, etc., where the
% necessary sections, bibliography, figures, etc. are included for the sake of the organization
% 3.5 - You can find below a template for a plain chapter (chap1) and an article chapter (chap2) that
% you can adapt to your work
% 3.6 - Comment/uncomment the chapters as necessary and duplicate the provided template folders
%  to create new chapters for your work
% 3.6 - Open each of the chapters below and follow the instructions provided
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% leave this uncommented for Chapter 1

% STEP 4 - BIBLIOGRAPHY
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% 4.1 - There are several approaches for bibliography management with LaTeX and this template
% includes three options (Bibitems, BibTeX, and Sortedbib), which you can choose from the provided
% templates below
% 4.2 - Bibitems consists of a list of bibliography items supplied with the command \bibitem, which
% later can be referenced with the command \cite
% 4.3 - It is the simplest approach or creating a bibliography for your work, but you have to manually
% formatting the bibliographic entries according to some style you chose
% 4.4 - Moreover, the reference numbers are attributed according to the order they are provided to
% LaTeX (and not according to the order of citation), and all the bibliographic entries are present in
% the references section of the generated PDF document, even if they are not cited
% 4.5 - Compiling with pdflatex twice is required for cross-references of bibliographic entries to be
% correctly generated and referenced in the generated PDF document
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% 4.6 - BibTeX consists of a bibliography database of formatting independent information of the
% references for the work
% 4.7 - Each bibliographic entry has a given type (article, book, proceedings, etc.) to determine the
% automatic formatting of the reference in the generated PDF document
% 4.8 - Moreover, the reference numbers are attributed according to the order they are cited (and
% not according to the order they are provided to LaTeX), and only the cited bibliographic entries are
% present in the references section of the generated PDF document
% 4.9 - Compiling with the sequence pdflatex, bibtex, and finally pdflatex twice is required for
% cross-references of bibliographic entries to be correctly generated and referenced in the generated
% PDF document
% 4.10 - Several bibliography files can be provided to the command \bibliography separated with
% commas and the file extension .bib is required for the bibliography databases
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% 4.11 - Sortedbib is similar to Bibitems, but the command \bibitem needs to be replaced with
% \addbib and the command \cite needs to be replaced with \citebib (you need to perform these
% changes in this template if you choose to use Sortedbib)
% 4.12 - It keeps the simplicity of the Bibitems approach of creating a bibliography for your work,
% but the reference numbers are attributed as in BibTeX, that is, according to the order they are cited
% (and not according to the order they are provided to LaTeX), and only the cited bibliographic
% entries are present in the references section of the generated PDF document
% 4.13 - Compiling with pdflatex twice is required for cross-references of bibliographic entries to be
% correctly generated and referenced in the generated PDF document as for Bibitems
% 4.14 - Although it avoids the compilation complexity of the BibTeX approach, you still have to
% manually formatting the bibliographic entries according to some style you chose as in Bibitems
% 4.15 - The bibliography file needs to be provided with the command \input placed before the
% command \begin{document} and afer the preamble
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% 4.16 - Separating the bibliography by chapters is useful when each chapter needs to have its own
% bibliography (see further instructions in the template chapters provided)
% 4.17 - Individual references sections are included at the end of each chapter and, in that case,
% BibTeX needs to be used since the other approaches are not capable of producing the same results
% 4.18 - The compilation becomes more complex as several stages are required and, therefore,
% running the script "./makemain.sh" provided in this template folder for Unix-based systems is
% easier than manually executing all the compilation steps required
% 4.19 - If using individual bibliographies for the chapters, leave commented out all the commands
% provided below and uncomment the corresponding commands provided in each chapter

% leave this uncommented for the bibliography with Bibitems

%=============================================================
% STEP 5 - APPENDICES
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% 5.1 â€“ Appendices should appear after the bibliography and should be named "Appendix A",
% "Appendix B", and so on in the order that the information is mentioned in the document
% 5.2 - Appendices can be introduced as regular chapters with sections, subsections, subsubsections,
% and paragraphs and can contain figures, tables, and equations
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% leave this uncommented for Appendix A
